## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r code, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("/Users/tgjoen/datasciencecoursera/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity.csv", header=TRUE)
attach(activity)
names(activity)
total_steps<-aggregate(activity[1],by=activity[2], FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
#total_steps<-tapply(activity[1],date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
hist(total_steps$steps, breaks=20,main="Histogram of total number of steps per day",xlab="Steps per day")
mean_day<-mean(total_steps)
median_day<-median(total_steps)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
